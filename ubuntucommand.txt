Install Avro in ubuntu 16.04



##########For Ubuntu 16.04 (32/64-bit)

Please run these commands from the terminal. Make sure you are in the right directory.

wget "https://github.com/maateen/avro/releases/download/v2.0/avro_2.0-1_all.deb"
sudo dpkg -i avro_2.0-1_all.deb

If you get any dependency errors, then also run the following command:

sudo apt-get install -f

I hope, all is well now and the installation has been finished.

Go to System Settings -> Language Support from Unity Launcher Look at the Keyboard input method system Select IBus and close the window.

I believe that you need to restart IBus to make everything work fine. Try the following command:

ibus restart

After this a "reboot" is required. Now go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Text Entry. Search and add Avro Phonetic as input source. That's all.


############## Remove locked file folder or file

sudo rm -rf file/folderName

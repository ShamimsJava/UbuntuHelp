To set Oracle JDK8 as default, install the "oracle-java8-set-default" package.

Install Avro in ubuntu 16.04



##########For Ubuntu 16.04 (32/64-bit)

Please run these commands from the terminal. Make sure you are in the right directory.

wget "https://github.com/maateen/avro/releases/download/v2.0/avro_2.0-1_all.deb"
sudo dpkg -i avro_2.0-1_all.deb

If you get any dependency errors, then also run the following command:

sudo apt-get install -f

I hope, all is well now and the installation has been finished.

Go to System Settings -> Language Support from Unity Launcher Look at the Keyboard input method system Select IBus and close the window.

I believe that you need to restart IBus to make everything work fine. Try the following command:

ibus restart

After this a "reboot" is required. Now go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Text Entry. Search and add Avro Phonetic as input source. That's all.

############# How to install Netbeans from .sh file


    navigate to Downloads folder:

    finally run the script:

    ./netbeans-8.2-javase-linux.sh


######## Set JAVA_HOME path


You can set your JAVA_HOME in /etc/profile as Petronilla Escarabajo suggests. But the preferred location for JAVA_HOME or any system variable is /etc/environment.

Open /etc/environment in any text editor like nano or gedit and add the following line:

JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/open-jdk"

(java path could be different)

Use source to load the variables, by running this command:

source /etc/environment

Then check the variable, by running this command:

echo $JAVA_HOME

Update

Usually most linux systems source /etc/environment by default. If your system doesn't do that add the following line to ~/.bashrc (Thanks @pje)

source /etc/environment
